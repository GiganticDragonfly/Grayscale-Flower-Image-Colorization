    "In the following code we built a convolutional neural network using keras library,<br>\n",
    "that gets as an input 32X32 pixels grayscale images of flowers, and generates an output of 96X96 colored flowers images.\n",

    "<hr>\n",
    "* <b>Data-Sets</b><br>\n",
    "We used a data set that contains 8189 pairs of grayscale and colored flower images<br>\n",
    "The training set is consisted of 70% of the images, while the test set is consisted of 30% of them. 10% of the training images are used for validation.<br>\n",

    "* <b>Model's Network Architecture</b><br>\n",
    "We've been experimenting with several different designs of the network.<br>\n",
    "In every model we chose to use RELU activation function on the hidden layers of the network.<br>\n",
    "On the output layer we used sigmoid function in order to output values between 0 and 1.<br>\n",
    "Generally the network processed the input image in such a way that it has been shrinked on the first few layers and than upscaled to the desired output dimensions. We used strides and up-sampling in order to do so.<br>\n",
    "We achieved the best results for this assignment using the described method.<br>\n",
    "Overfitting on these kind of networks is a subjective matter, therefore we needed to examine the results and determine wether they match our expectations.\n",
    "<hr>\n",
    "* <b>Model's Training</b><br>\n",
    "We normalized the input pixel values to be between 0 and 1, and used the mean square error loss function to measure our results.<br>\n",
    "After that we also tried using the \"msle\" loss function which we found more suitable for our project.\n",
    "On both occasions we used the \"rmsprop\" optimizer to minimize our loss.\n",
    "<hr>\n",
    "* <b>Performance</b><br>\n",
    "We were suprised by our initial results, it seemed like the network recognized the shapes and textures of the input images, and also colored them nicely.<br>\n",
    "The only issue we had is the lack of sharpness of the output images.<br>\n",
    "We then added more convolutional layers to deepen our network and we increased the amount of filters in each layer dramatically. Furthermore we tested different batch sizes and number of epochs.<br>\n",
    "The output images became more sharp and clear, the results were way over our expectations.\n",
